# DeepSeek Paper Trading Bot

This repository contains a paper-trading bot that runs against the Binance REST API while leveraging DeepSeek for trade decision-making. Inspired by the https://nof1.ai/ challenge. A live deployment is available at [llmtest.coininspector.pro](https://llmtest.coininspector.pro/), where you can access the dashboard and review the complete bot conversation log.

The app persists its runtime data (portfolio state, AI messages, and trade history) inside a dedicated `data/` directory so it can be mounted as a volume when running in Docker.

## This is how it looks when running

## How It Works
- Every three minutes the bot fetches fresh candles for `ETH`, `SOL`, `XRP`, `BTC`, `DOGE`, and `BNB`, updates EMA/RSI/MACD indicators, and snapshots current positions.
- The snapshot is turned into a detailed DeepSeek prompt that includes balances, unrealised PnL, open orders, and indicator values.
- A trading rules system prompt (see below) is sent alongside the user prompt so the model always receives the risk framework before making decisions.
- DeepSeek replies with JSON decisions (`hold`, `entry`, or `close`) per asset. The bot enforces position sizing, places entries/closes, and persists results.
- Portfolio state, trade history, AI requests/responses, and per-iteration console transcripts are written to `data/` for later inspection or dashboard visualisation.

## System Prompt & Decision Contract
DeepSeek is primed with a risk-first system prompt that stresses:
- Never risking more than 1â€“2% of capital on a trade
- Mandatory stop-loss orders and pre-defined exit plans
- Favouring trend-following setups, patience, and written trade plans
- Thinking in probabilities while keeping position sizing under control

Each iteration DeepSeek receives the live portfolio snapshot and must answer **only** with JSON resembling:

```json
{
  "ETH": {
    "signal": "entry",
    "side": "long",
    "quantity": 0.5,
    "profit_target": 3150.0,
    "stop_loss": 2880.0,
    "leverage": 5,
    "confidence": 0.72,
    "risk_usd": 150.0,
    "invalidation_condition": "If price closes below 4h EMA20",
    "justification": "Momentum + RSI reset on support"
  }
}
```

If DeepSeek responds with `hold`, the bot still records unrealised PnL, accumulated fees, and the rationale in `ai_decisions.csv`.

## Telegram Notifications
Configure `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env` to receive a message after every iteration. The notification mirrors the console output (positions opened/closed, portfolio summary, and any warnings) so you can follow progress without tailing logs. Leave the variables empty to run without Telegram.

## Performance Metrics

The console summary and dashboard track both realized and unrealized performance:

- **Sharpe ratio** (dashboard) is computed from closed trades using balance snapshots after each exit.
- **Sortino ratio** (bot + dashboard) comes from the equity curve and penalises downside volatility only, making it more informative when the sample size is small.

By default the Sortino ratio assumes a 0% risk-free rate. Override it by defining `SORTINO_RISK_FREE_RATE` (annualized decimal, e.g. `0.03` for 3%) or, as a fallback, `RISK_FREE_RATE` in your `.env`.

## Prerequisites

- Docker 24+ (any engine capable of building Linux/AMD64 images)
- A `.env` file with the required API credentials:
  - `BN_API_KEY` / `BN_SECRET` for Binance access
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for DeepSeek requests
  - Optional: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` for push notifications

## Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t tradebot .
```

## Prepare Local Data Storage

Create a directory on the host that will receive the bot's CSV/JSON artifacts:

```bash
mkdir -p ./data
```

The container stores everything under `/app/data`. Mounting your host folder to that path keeps trade history and AI logs between runs.

## Run the Bot in Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  tradebot
```

- `--env-file .env` injects API keys into the container.
- The volume mount keeps `portfolio_state.csv`, `portfolio_state.json`, `ai_messages.csv`, `ai_decisions.csv`, and `trade_history.csv` outside the container so you can inspect them locally.
- By default the app writes to `/app/data`. To override, set `TRADEBOT_DATA_DIR` and update the volume mount accordingly.

## Optional: Streamlit Dashboard

To launch the monitoring dashboard instead of the trading bot, run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  -p 8501:8501 \
  tradebot \
  streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8501> to access the UI.

The top-level metrics include Sharpe and Sortino ratios alongside balance, equity, and PnL so you can quickly assess both realised returns and downside-adjusted performance.

## Running Locally (Without Docker)

While Docker is recommended for a consistent environment, you can also run the bot and dashboard directly on your local machine.

### 1. Setup a Virtual Environment

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Or on Windows
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example `.env` file and add your API keys.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now edit the `.env` file to add your credentials.

### 4. Run the Bot

Launch the main trading bot script.

```bash
python bot.py
```

### 5. Run the Dashboard

To view the dashboard, run the following command in a separate terminal (with the virtual environment still active).

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Development Notes

- The Docker image sets `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for cleaner logging.
- When running locally without Docker, the bot still writes to the `data/` directory next to the source tree (or to `TRADEBOT_DATA_DIR` if set).
- Existing files inside `data/` are never overwritten automatically; if headers or columns change, migrate the files manually.
- The repository already includes sample CSV files in `data/` so you can explore the dashboard immediately. These files will be overwritten as the bot runs.
